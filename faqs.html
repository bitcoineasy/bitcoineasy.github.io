      <button class="accordion">Bitcoin is too expensive, what will be the next money maker?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <br>
        <p>Compared to what is Bitcoin too much? Compared to Gold Bitcoin is very cheap. Gold marketcap: 8 Trillion vs Bitcoin marketcap: 0.18 Trillion.</p>

        <p>Gold is 40 times more expensive than Bitcoin even though today one ounce of Gold costs 1,490$ and one Bitcoin costs 10,000$.</p>

        <p>Don’t fall victim to the unit bias. Just because the unit price of some asset is less than the unit price of another asset doesn’t mean it is cheaper.</p>

        <p>Lets compare Bitcoin to another Cryptocurrency.

        <p>One Ethereum costs 200$ today. If you buy 1 Ethereum you own 0.000001% of all Ethereum. If you buy one Bitcoin you own 0.000005% of all Bitcoin.</p>

        <p>If you spend 10,000$ on 50 Ethereum you own 0.00005% of all Ethereum. You get 50 Ethereum instead of 1 Bitcoin but your percentage ownership in the network only increases by 10. In other words Bitcoin is only 10 times more expensive than
        <p>Ethereum instead of 50 times as the price difference suggests.</p>

      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Is Bitcoin backed by anything?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <br>
        <p>Bitcoins are not backed by anything. Your government currency isn’t backed by anything either. The gold standard was abolished by President Nixon in 1971. Before 1971 the USD in theory was redeemable for gold. Now over 90% of government
          fiat currency is just numbers saved on computers.</p>

          <p>Bitcoins have different properties that the market trusts. The inflation is fixed and cant be changed. There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins. This is provable and verifiable. Bitcoin has never been hacked in its 10 years of existence
          thanks to the proof of work system that makes Bitcoin the most secure computer network in the world.
          These two properties make Bitcoin sound money like gold.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">
        Apart from Bitcoin, which ones are other interesting virtual coins, and why is that?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <br>
        <p>Big claims and promises are made regarding the advantages and innovations of other Cryptocurrencies. This is mainly because of marketing teams, evangelists and the community of people invested in those Altcoins.
          Without any knowledge on how Blockchains work one is easily swept away by the marketing language. Here are some of the most important aspects to know.</p>

          <h3>Simple vs complex programming languages</h3>

          <p>Bitcoin falls into the money category. Bitoin is also programmable but not to the same extent as Ethereum or other smart contracts platforms like Tezos.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has a programming language that has limits to what programs can be written in it. Smart contracts platforms use touring complete languages that allow you to write any program you want.</p>

          <p>The disadvantages of touring completeness is that it also allows you to make serious mistakes and introduce bugs into the code. Once you write bugs into a Blockchain they can not be erased. Hundreds of millions have been lost because of
          this on Ethereum.</p>

          <p>The advantages are clear. People are using Ethereum to build decentralized insurance, lending, stable money, digital collectibles, exchanges and much more. These applications are called dapps or decentralized applications. Many of these
          dapps use their own tokens (other word for cryptocurrency). Most have issued and sold these cryptocurrencies to raise money and often it is not clear what other purpose they have. Be especially careful when buying dapp tokens.</p>

          <h3>Different value propositions</h3>
          <p>The value proposition of Ether, the currency on Ethereum, is that you need it for every transaction on the network.</p>

          <p>The value proposition of Bitcoin is that the code is safe and robust, the inflation is fixed and there will only be 21 million Bitcoins.</p>

          <h3>Scaling Blockchains</h3>

          <p>Because you can do so much on Ethereum, the blockchain size is growing exponentially. Blockchains are slow compared to conventional servers and 1000 times more expensive to run. It is not clear yet if Ethereum or other smart contracts
          platforms will ever become viable for mass adoption.

          <p>Bitcoin and Ethereum use Proof of Work (using energy for mining to secure the network). Ethereum wants to switch to Proof of Stake (using stake (coins) to secure the network through financial penalties.) It is not clear if it will work and
          if Ethereum will be decentralized enough since this has never been done before.

          <p>Bitcoins Blockchain on the other hand is growing slowly and will fit on a normal laptop for many decades to come. This is important for decentralization. Blockchains only make sense if they are decentralized enough. Everybody in the world
          needs to be able to run a copy of the blockchain.

          <h3>Privacy coins</h3>

          <p>One noteworthy subcategory of the money coins are the privacy coins. They don’t record transactions on the Blockchain and therefore it is impossible to know who the participants in the network are. Check out the Grin and Monero privacy
          coins.

          <p>Apart from Bitcoin, Ethereum and Grin, there are not many other interesting projects in the cryptocurrency space.</p>

      <button class="accordion">What protections do cryptocurrency systems have against theft and fraud?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <br>
        <p>Cryptocurrencies use public-key cryptography.</p>

        <p>Bitcoins are not stored on your computer or smartphone. Bitcoins are just a number on the decentralized Bitcoin network (Blockchain).</p>

        <p>When you buy 0.1 Bitcoin and transfer them to your Bitcoin wallet, every computer in the Bitcoin network (Bitcoin nodes) will save a copy of the transaction. In other words everybody knows that your address has 0.1 Bitcoin.</p>

        <p>When you create your wallet you are given a private key. This private key gives you access to those Bitcoin. The Bitcoin are only as safe as the private key.</p>

        <p>A convenient way for maximum security are hardware wallets like the Ledger Nano. The private key of a hardware wallet will never be on a device with internet and therefore impossible for hackers to steal.</p>
        <p>Bitcoin has never been hacked in its 10 years of existence. The stories you read about Bitcoin being hacked always refer to companies that didn’t securely store their private keys.</p>
