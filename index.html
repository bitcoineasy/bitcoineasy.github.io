            <h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
            <p>Bitcoin is digital cash that can be used without a third party (a company in between of the sender and the receiver that is responsible for making the transactions).</p>
            <p>Why is this significant? It works instantly, 24/7 and you can send it anywhere in the world to anybody you want. No bank account, credit card, or paypal account required.</p>
            <h2>How is Bitcoin different from Paypal, Apple Pay or other payment providers?</h2>
            <p>There is no "Bitcoin company" and you don't need to sign up anywhere. All you need is a Bitcoin wallet. There are paper wallets, software wallets and hardware wallets. These wallets contain the keys to the Bitcoins.</p>
            <p>Bitcoins are not stored on your computer or phone, they are stored on the decentralized Bitcoin computer network (Blockchain) and can be accessed with a password (also called private key).</p>
            <p>Bitcoin is the most secure computer network in the world. Since its invention in 2009 it has never been hacked. The "Bitcoin hacks" that you have heard about involved companies that didn't protect the private keys well enough. Imagine it like this: Bitcoin is like Gold in an indestructible safe. You can only get it if you find the key.</p>
            <h2>Does Bitcoin unnecessarily waste too much Energy?</h2>
            <p>No... (Answer will follow shortly). For now look at how much energy Bitcoin comsumes compared to other technologies <a href="https://cbeci.org/comparisons/" target="_blank">cbeci.org/comparisons</a></p>
            <h2>Does the Bitcoin price go up and down too much? (Is it too volatile?) </h2>
            (Answer will follow shortly)
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitcoineasy/images/master/bitcoin_volatility.jpg" alt="Bitcoin price history chart" class="responsive">
            <p>The above image shows the histort of the Bitcoin price until 10. August 2019. Bitcoin goes up and down like nothing else. (Answer will follow shortly)</p>
            <h2>Is Bitcoin better than normal money?</h2>
            (Answer will follow shortly)
            <h2>Why is the separation between money and state important?</h2>
            <p>(answer will follow shortly)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>QE</li>
                    <li>Currency Wars</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Who writes the code for Bitcoin?</h2>
            <p>Bitcoin is an open source project and everybody can contribute to the Bitcoin code on Github <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin">github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin</a></p>
            <p>Here is the list of everybody who has contributed to the open source Bitcoin code <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors" target="_blank">github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors</a></p>
            <h2>How does Bitcoin work?</h2>
            <p>This is the best video I have found on how the Bitcoin blockchain and mining works. It slowly explains the most important parts (blocks, nonces, hashes) and how they work together in making Bitcoin secure.</p>
