            <h2 id="question1">What is Bitcoin?</h2>
            <p>Bitcoin is digital cash that can be used without a third party (a company in between of the sender and the receiver).</p>
            <p>Why is this significant? It is very fast, works 24/7 and you can send it anywhere in the world to anybody you want. No bank account, credit card, or paypal account required.</p>
            <p>Bitcoin is the most secure computer network in the world. Since its invention in 2009 it has never been hacked. The "Bitcoin hacks" that you have heard about involved companies that did't protect the private keys well enough. Imagine it like this: Bitcoin is like Gold in an indestructible safe. You can only get it if you find the key.</p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h2 id="question2">How is Bitcoin different from Paypal, Apple Pay or other payment providers?</h2>
            <p>There is no "Bitcoin company" and you don't need to sign up anywhere. All you need is a Bitcoin wallet. There are paper wallets, software wallets and hardware wallets. These wallets contain the keys to the Bitcoins.</p>
            <p>Bitcoins are not stored on your computer or phone, they are stored on the decentralized Bitcoin computer network (Blockchain) and can be accessed with a password (also called private key).</p>
            <p>Bitcoin is permissionless. That means that you can use Bitcoin to accept payments for your business without signing up anywhere or doing any paperwork. You just post your Bitcoin address on your website like the Bitcoin donations address at the bottom of this one ;)</p>
            <br>


            <h2 id="question3">Does Bitcoin unnecessarily waste too much energy?</h2>
            <p>The worlds hydro, biofuel, solar and wind energy combined could power the Bitcoin network 98 times. The amount of electricity consumed every year in always-on but inactive home devices in the USA alone could power the Bitcoin network for 3.5 years. See these comparisons and others here: <a href="https://cbeci.org/comparisons/"
            target="_blank">cbeci.org/comparisons</a></p>
            <p>The best summary of Bitcoins energy consumption I found in this blog article from the International Energy Agency: <a href="https://www.iea.org/newsroom/news/2019/july/bitcoin-energy-use-mined-the-gap.html" target="_blank">IEA Bitcoin energy consumption</a></p>
            <p>As you can see, there is no reason to be afraid of Bitcoins energy consumption.</p>
            <br>

            <h2 id="question4">Does the Bitcoin price go up and down too much? (Is it too volatile?) </h2>
            <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitcoineasy/images/master/bitcoin_volatility.jpg" target="_blank">  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitcoineasy/images/master/bitcoin_volatility.jpg" alt="Bitcoin price history chart" class="responsive"/></a>
            <p>The above image shows the history of the Bitcoin price until 10. August 2019. Bitcoin goes up and down like nothing else.</p>
            <p>(Answer will follow shortly)</p>
            <br>

            <h2 id="toolateforbitcoin"> Is it too late to buy Bitcoin?</h2>
            <font color="red">This is not financial advice! Models are not accurate predictions of the future.</font>
            <p>In the Bitcoin <a href="https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25c" target="_blank">stock-to-flow model</a> developed by Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD" target="_blank">PlanB</a>, the Bitcoin price reaches a price of 105000$ by 2021, 1300000$ by 2025 and $15000000 by 2028. Stock-to-flow models accurately calculate the value of Gold and other precious metals. According to this model you are still not too late if you want to profit from Bitcoins price appreciation. If Bitcoin only catches up with Golds 8 trillion dollar marketcap, one Bitcoin would be worth around 300.000$.</p>
            <p>Bitcoin stock-to-flow model graph:</p>

            <br>

            <h2 id="question5">Is Bitcoin better than normal money?</h2>
            <p>There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin. "Normal money" like US Dollars or Euros dont have a fixed supply and can be created by the government and by private banks for their personal advantage. This gives them too much power and inflates the money supply. The rising money supply causes the money to loose value every year. Bitcoin on the other hand can not be inflated by governments or private banks. In Bitcoin, the same rules apply for everybody.</p>

            <p>The following video is the best explanation I could find on how the process of money creation works:</p>

            <br>

            <h2 id="question6">Why is the separation of money and state important?</h2>
            <p>(answer will follow shortly) Quantitative Easing, Currency Wars, Debt, haircuts...</p>
            <br>

            <h2 id="question7">Who writes the code for Bitcoin?</h2>
            <p>Bitcoin is an open source project and everybody can contribute to the Bitcoin code on Github <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin" target="_blank">github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin</a></p>

            <p>Here is the list of everybody who has contributed to the open source Bitcoin code <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors" target="_blank">Bitcoin Github contributors</a></p>
            <br>

            <h2 id="question8">How does Bitcoin work?</h2>
            <p>Bitcoins are created in a process called mining which also makes Bitcoin so secure. Computers do a lot of calculations and get Bitcoins as a reward. To "hack" Bitcoin you would need at least 51% of all the energy that all Bitcoin miners in the entire world are using for a prolonged period of time.</p>

            <p>This is the best video I have found on how the Bitcoin blockchain and mining works. It slowly explains the most important parts (blocks, nonces, hashes) and how they work together in making Bitcoin secure.</p>

            <br>

            <h2 id="question9">Could a state attack Bitcoin?</h2>
            <p>In this video Andreas Antonopoulos explains how it would be practically impossible for a nation state to attack Bitcoin and how it would make Bitcoin stronger and the price probably go up after the attack</p>
